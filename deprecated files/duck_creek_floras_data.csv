The leaves, roots and sap are poisonous and irritant, and can cause mouth ulceration. Seedbank persistence. Short, days-1 year. Notes. Most cultivated Agapanthus are cultivars or hybrids of Agapanthus praecox. Sheds old outer leaves each year, replacing them with new leaves from the apex of the growing shoot. Highly variable species, consisting of three subspecies: subsp. praecox, subsp. orientalis and subsp. minimus. Subsp. praecox is distinguished by its longer perianth segments (50 mm or longer) and fewer leaves (10-11 per plant) which are leathery and sub-erect (spreading rather than arching). Species readily hybridise with each other. Survives well in poor soils but prefers rich, well-drained soil with ample organic matter. Requires adequate water in spring and summer.

Ornamental, medicines. Similar exotic species. Agapanthus praecox subsp. orientalis. Suggested method of management and control. Small infestations can be dug out. All of the rhizome must be removed and destroyed off-site, as any remaining rhizomes will regrow even if turned upside down.

Soil, animals (adhesion), tyres, clothing. Toxicity. Causes allergies in humans, poisonous to stock. Seedbank persistence. Long term, 5+ years. Notes. Major weed of warm temperate and tropical areas around the world. Naturalised in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland. Forms a dense monoculture on bare ground and/or disturbed areas and capable of outcompeting native plant species. Prefers light soils, warm temperatures and sufficient moisture. Spreads vegetatively and by prolific amounts of seed that remains viable for a number of years. Fruits are indehiscent, one-seeded, and have sharp bracts or burrs which are problematic in agriculture and residential areas. Seed germinates in spring and goes on to form a dense matt during summer if adequate moisture is available. Roots develop at the nodes of the spreading stems. Has a deep, woody taproot that allows plants to regenerate following drought. The top growth dies off in winter and the dormant plant is sustained by the fleshy taproot.

"Arctotheca","Arctotheca calendula","General Biology. Growth form. Herb. Life form. Annual. Reproduction. Seed, stolons. Dispersal. Wind, water, movement of contaminated soil or mud, animals. Toxicity. Can be poisonous to mammals, through accumulating potentially toxic levels of nitrate. Seedbank persistence. Highly variable, but may be up to 8 years. Notes. Widespread and common in temperate areas. Can be biennial. Colonises bare soil and disturbed sites. It is likely to impact on soil moisture and nutrient availability, however does not seems to compete well in natural undisturbed ecosystems. Seems to be a relatively poor competitor with native species, but if established can have a moderate impact on native plant communities. Can reproduce vegetatively by stolon fragments. Germination is promoted by light. The early onset of low winter temperatures may postpone germination until the following autumn. Biotypes have evolved resistance to Group D/22 (Bipyridiliums) and Group L herbicides. Can go on to produce seed under defoliation. Persistence of seed in the soil is strongly influenced by the ecotype/location and degree of burial. Low rainfall events can favour capeweed germination before other species as the woolly seed cover attracts moisture and reduces desiccation. Seed dormancy is overcome by high summer temperatures. There may be large differences in seed dormancy characteristics, with genetically distinct populations adapted to particular environments.. Additional information. Origin. Southern Africa. History of use/introduction. Seed contaminant. Suggested method of management and control. Chip out small infestations,ensuring root is severed well below ground level to prevent re-sprouting from the crown. For large infestations apply LontrelÂ® 6 ml/10 L (300 ml/ha) in early growth stages. Glyphosate at 0.2% will provide some selective control if the plants are young or at the budding stage, otherwise spot spraying glyphosate at 10 ml/L will control capeweed at all growth stages. A combination of chemical and physical control with follow up treatment provides optimal control. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.

"Axonopus","Axonopus fissifolius","General Biology. Growth form. Grass. Life form. Perennial, rhizomatous/stoloniferous. Reproduction. Seed, rhizomes and stolons. Dispersal. Wind, water movement, vehicles, grazing animals. Photosynthetic Pathway. C4. Seedbank persistence. Short, days to 1 year. Fire response. Fire is rare in its natural habitat, however plants quickly recover and resprout. Notes. Naturalised in Africa, Asia, other parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Prefers sandy, moist soils and tolerant of heavy soils, low pH and poor fertility. Does not withstand prolonged flooding. Has poor drought resistance and moderate shade tolerance. Rapidly spreads by stolons and rhizomes under favourable conditions and produces prolific lightweight seed. Can withstand heavy defoliation and grazing. Additional information. Origin. Tropical America. History of use/introduction. Widely used in the United States to prevent erosion and stabilise road embankments, pasture, lawns. Similar exotic species. Axonopus fissifolius. Suggested method of management and control. Spray when actively growing from spring to autumn with 13 ml/L FusiladeÂ® Forte + wetting agent or for generic fluazifop-p (212g/L active ingredient) 8ml/L + wetting agent. 2,2_DPA at 4.8 kg/ha may also be effective.

In nitrogen-rich soils can concentrate hydrogen cyanide. Seedbank persistence. 20-40 years. Notes. Infestations may be very dense and compete vigorously with other plants. Prefers disturbed highly organic nitrate-rich soil and requires bare ground for establishment and persistence. Flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female parts) and are wind-pollinated. Rain, nitrate and light promote germination. Several generations may occur in one season due to rapid growth and seed production. Strongly allelopathic, capable of reducing germination and growth of other species. Exhibits great morphological plasticity and is able to adapt to different environments including shade by delaying seed set, growing taller and having greater leaf area. Produces a high proportion of dormant seed with no special dispersal mechanism. Additional information. History of use/introduction. Medicines, dyes, food. Similar exotic species. Chenopodium murale. Suggested method of management and control. Manual removal, particularly when plants are young, is effective due to shallow root systems, and can be done up to stem elongation and before seeding in summer. Highly susceptible to mowing/slashing before flowering. Relatively tolerant to many herbicides and any sub-lethal rates of herbicide will result in the same high seed germination rates as unsprayed plants.

Hot fire kills mature plants. Cooler fires results in some resprouting. Fire can destroy seed in surface soil but releases dormancy in seed buried deeper in the soil profile. Notes. A number of biological control agents have been released in Australia. There are two subspecies, monilifera (boneseed) and rotunda (bitou bush). Subspecies rotunda has not been found in Western Australia. Germination is promoted by soil disturbance and fire. Forms a very large soil seed bank, up to 5000 seeds per square metre.

Seed in the top 2cm of mostly disappears in one year but may last up to four years. Seed buried at 20cm may last up to 50 years. Fire response. Resprouts after fire. Fire creates conditions suitable for mass germination of soil-stored seed. Notes. Occurs in subhumid to cool-temperate regions usually on more fertile heavier soils. An aggressive weed in disturbed sites. Can be biennial. Flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female parts), are self-pollinated or cross-pollinated by bees, flies, moths, butterflies and beetles. Intolerant of shade and requires moist soil to establish. Can be dispersed by the wind over a large area, however the pappus can readily detach from seed at maturity, leading the majority of seeds to fall within a short distance of the parent plant. Seedlings and young rosettes are susceptible to drought over summer. After germination a major root system develops rapidly, whilst a rosette is more slowly formed above ground. Peak flowering normally occurs in late spring to early summer. Soil disturbance promotes germination. Seeds mature and may disperse within 7 to 10 days of flowering. Seed viability is high. Germination is stimulated by mositure, disturbance and/or nutrients. The rapid disappearance of seed from the soil surface means that management practises that result in seed burial should be avoided.. Additional information. Origin. Western Asia, Europe, North Africa. History of use/introduction. Food. Suggested method of management and control. Glyphosate at 0.5% provides effective control of seedling and adult plants, alternatively spot spray LontrelÂ® 6 ml/10 L (300 ml/ha) + wetting agent, from rosette stage to early flowering. Blanket wipers or wick applicators using 50% glyphosate can provide some selective control. Eliminating seed production is the most effective mechanical control technique. Mowing/slashing at bud or early bloom stage will cause plants to resprout. However, close mowing or cutting twice per season will usually prevent seed production.

Wind, water, slashing, mammals, garden refuse. Photosynthetic Pathway. C3. Seedbank persistence. 2 years. Fire response. Resprouts. Notes. Capable of altering vegetation structure and decreasing diversity of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. Often found in open sunny sites which receive additional moisture. Capable of becoming established on a wide variety of soil types. Sensitive to frost at the seedling stage but becomes more frost tolerant with age. Also tolerant of drought, fire, salinity and waterlogging. Intolerant of prolonged or intensive grazing especially when plants are small. Reproduces both sexually and asexually. There are two sexual forms: monoecious (bisexual) and female. Seed from female plants have long fine hairs on the lemma making them suitable for wind dispersal; hermaphrodite seeds lack these hairs. Female plants cannot produce viable seeds unless fertilized from a hermaphrodite plant resulting in vast numbers of viable seeds from each flower head. Hermaphrodites produce fewer viable seeds but are still able to reproduce in the absence of females. Seeds are primarily wind-dispersed and are able to disperse large distances. Seed can germinate under a wide range of conditions, however germination is highest in sandy soils, with available water and under shaded conditions compared with complete light. Recruitment and survival of seedlings is enhanced by soil disturbance and can be impacted by presence of generalist herbivores. Additional information. Origin.

"Cynodon","Cynodon dactylon","General Biology. Growth form. Grass. Life form. Perennial, stoloniferous/rhizomatous. Reproduction. Seed, rhizomes, stolons. Dispersal. Water, ants, wind, slashing, garden refuse, deliberate planting. Photosynthetic Pathway. C4. Toxicity. Can be toxic to animals due production of cyanogenic compounds. Seedbank persistence. 3-4 years. Fire response. Survives most fire, reshoots from rhizomes. Notes. Inhabits open sites subject to frequent disturbances such as grazing, flooding and fire. Prefers fertile sandy to silty soils or alluvium. Favours moist and warm climates. Shade reduces vigor. Known host of pathogens and pests. Documented as allelopathic, capable of reducing the germination and growth of other species. Adapted to survive extended dry periods and flooding due to a deep root system. Generally tolerant of low soil pH and high salt concentration, however is susceptible to cold temperatures. Growth slows in cold weather, in shade and/or dry soils. A number of variants and cultivars have been developed worldwide, mainly to increase drought resistance, cold hardiness, disease resistance and forage production. Rhizomes shoot at 10 degrees celsius, but shooting can occur at 30-40 degrees celsius. Rhizomes are resistant to drought and waterlogging, and sensitive to light. Additional information. Origin. Africa, southern Europe. History of use/introduction. Turf, pasture. Similar native species. Sporobolus virginicus. Suggested method of management and control. Small infestations may be dug out, ensuring removal of all rhizomes and stolons, however it is difficult to eradicate without herbicides. Spray FusiladeÂ® Forte at 13 ml/L + wetting agent or for generic fluazifop-p (212g/L active ingredient) 8mL/L + wetting agent when plants are small and beginning new growth, or 1% glyphosate in late spring/summer and autumn when rhizomes are actively growing. In sensitive areas try painting runners or crowns with 50% glyphosate. Follow-up is nearly always required. Treatment is particularly effective after fire. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.

Seedbank persistence. Short, several months. Notes. Can flower and set seed repeatedly throughout the growing season. Seed can germinate over a wide pH range (between 5 and 10). Seedling emergence is greatest for seeds on the soil surface. Seeds are short-lived and do not form a large, persistent seed bank, even when buried. Adapted to heavy grazing and germination can increase after seed is consumed by cattle. Germination occurs at temperatures above 20Â°C, and is greatest under fluctuating temperatures between 20 and 35Â°C. The primary dispersal mechanism of seed over larger distances is human activity.

"Foeniculum","Foeniculum vulgare","General Biology. Growth form. Herb. Life form. Perennial. Reproduction. Root fragments, seed. Dispersal. Soil, machinery, water, birds, rodents, clothing, garden waste and soil movement. Toxicity. Contact with the sap or oil can cause photo-sensitivity and/or dermatitis in cattle. Ingestion of oil can be toxic to humans. Seedbank persistence. Medium to long term. Fire response. Resprouts from base after fire. Notes. Naturalised in temperate and tropical regions worldwide. Usually found in highly disturbed and/or open sites. Forms dense uniform stands where it outcompetes other plant species for light, nutrients and water. Can prevent re-establishment of native plants and alter the composition and structure of communities. Possibly allelopathic. Alters fire regimes by building an intense fast moving fire, although it does not burn well in spring. Prefers well drained, sandy soils. Tolerant of frost, drought, water logging and semi-aridity. Mature plants have a large deep taproot with many lateral roots. During a growing season plants usually include a mixture of living and dead hollow stems (canes). Initial growth during winter and spring is slow, then becomes rapid in early summer. Flowering stems die during late autumn and early winter, although some remain alive and begin to produce new leaves with the onset of rain. Plants generally do not flower until 18 months to 2 years old. Flowers are monoecious (have both male and female parts) and are insect-pollinated. With prolific seed production and high seed viability, it rapidly establishes a persistent seedbank. One plant can produce thousands of seed in the first year, seed output can then increase greatly in the second year. Additional information. Origin. Europe, Asia. History of use/introduction. Ornamental, spices, medicines. Suggested method of management and control. Persistent and difficult to eradicate. Manual methods are most effective for small and/or isolated infestations. Otherwise, spot spray with 1.5% glyphosate or metsulfuron methyl 0.7 g/10 L (20 g/ha) + PulseÂ®. Apply in spring just before flowering. Follow up control of seedlings. Combination of burning followed by spraying may be effective. Cutting or slashing temporarily reduces heights, but plants readily resprout.

Water, soil, machinery, animals (adhesion and ingestion), wind, contaminated hay or soil. Toxicity. Contains a toxin that causes dermatitis and photo-sensitivity in livestock. Seedbank persistence. 13+ years, with vaiblity declining from 7 years onwards. Fire response. Heat from fire stimulate germination of seed. Can resprout and sucker from deep rhizomes. Notes. Forms dense stands where it displaces native plant species, reduces wildlife habitat, depletes soil moisture, and in late summer may increase the fire hazard. Original infestations are usually associated with disturbance. Exhibits a high degree of phenotypic and genotypic variation. Appears well-adapted to a wide variety of habitats and climate conditions. Seedlings do not tolerate high salinity, litter and competition. Mature plants will survive long periods of inundation and have deep, extensive root systems. Has two distinct growth phases: autumn/winter prostrate basal growth and spring/summer erect woody stem growth. Vegetatively reproduces from lateral roots and root crowns, stimulated by grazing, fire and defoliation. Self-pollinated and insect-pollinated. Capable of producing tens of thousands of seed annually. Seeds have 4-6 months of after-ripening, reach maximum germinability at 12 months and require bare soil, sunlight and/or heavy rain for germination. Reaches maturity in two seasons, with the first year's growth directed mainly to establishment of the root system. Declared plant in New South Wales and many parts of the United States. A number of forms, varieties and subspecies have been recognised and readily forms hybrids with other Hypericum species.

"Lactuca","Lactuca serriola","General Biology. Growth form. Herb. Life form. Annual. Reproduction. Seed. Dispersal. Wind, water, soil movement. Toxicity. Possibly poisonous to mammals. Seedbank persistence. Short term, 1-3 years. Fire response. Can increase in abundance in suitable post-fire conditions. Notes. Can be biennial or a winter or summer annual. Colonises a range of disturbed habitats including wetlands. Exudes a white milky sap when damaged. Most seedlings emerge in autumn, grow slowly and form a rosette over winter, and then develop stems in spring. Long, warm autumns favour emergence and rosette establishment, and often result in large populations the following year. Plants emerging in spring have a shorter rosette phase before flowering and are often smaller than plants emerging in autumn.Seeds have an attached pappus for wind-dispersal, have no primary dormancy and only form a short term soil seedbank. Seed production is proportional to plant height, with taller plants able to produce as many as 2,300 seeds. Research has shown it has broadened its ecological amplitude, enabling it to invade a range of vegetation types. Many populations in southern Australia have developed resistance to Group 2 herbicides. Additional information. Origin. Eurasia, North Africa. History of use/introduction. Genetic resources (primary genetic relative of lettuce), ornamental, medicines. Suggested method of management and control. Manually remove small and/or isolated infestations, ensuring entire plant is removed especially the taproot. Apply glyphosate at early growth or rosette stages in spring, summer or autumn or metsulfuron methyl 5 g/ha (based on a minimum of 50 L/ha of water) + surfactant. Plants are difficult to control with herbicides once the flowering stems have begun to elongate. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.

Seedbank persistence. Possibly up to 100 years. Notes. Occupies high-light habitats and tends to increase as soil fertility increases. Able to flower and set seed within 2 months of germinating. Has a long flowering period and high seed set. Has a single long taproot allowing it to survive long periods of drought. Fresh seed has high levels of innate dormancy. Germinates in spring to autumn and grows rapidly. Spring germinating plants may flower when only a few centimetres high and survive over summer to become biennial. Germination is moderately sensitive to salt stress, and is not influenced by light but is stimulated by scarification. Morphologically variable between geographical locations. Plants growing in wamer areas have longer growth periods and higher maximum plant height compared to cool regions. Acts as a host for many pests and dieases, including viruses, fungus and nematodes. Anecdotal evidence suggests it solar tracks, which could increase the annual carbon gain by as much as 25%.

Flowers and sets prolific seed. Notes. In its native range it occurs in disturbed open habitats, often forming large stands. Widely distibuted outside its native range. Generally is a short-lived perennial but may be an annual. Displaces native vegetation and prevents the natural succession of native species. Germinates and grows under a wide range of temperature conditions with rates controlled by temperature when adequate moisture is available. Responds positively to addition of nutrients. Can be affected by mycorrhizal fungi which may play a role in facilitating or repelling invasion. Additional information. Origin. South Africa, parts of the Mediterranean, India, North Africa.

"Opuntia","Opuntia stricta","General Biology. Growth form. Shrub/Small Tree. Life form. Perennial. Reproduction. Asexually from stem fragments, flowers or immature fruits.. Dispersal. Local dispersal around existing clumps occurs when segments or fruit drop to the ground and take root. The plant fragments can be dispersed in flood waters or by native animals and stock.. Time of first flowering. Third year. Type of stem. Succulent. Seedbank persistence. 10 to 20 years.. Fire response. May not be killed in fire, may result in vigorous regrowth following fire. Very small plants and seeds will be destroyed in the hot fire.. Notes. These species are shrubs or small trees with jointed, succulent stems (pads) that are cylindrical, club-shaped or compressed. The areoles (spots on the stem segments) are tufted with barbed bristles (glochids) and with usually 1 or more stout spines. The leaves are mostly scale-like and conical to cylindrical (terete) in shape. The solitary and stalkless (sessile) flowers are produced on the areoles. The petals of Opuntia species found in Australia vary in colour from yellow, orange, red to purple. The fruits bear areoles, sometimes with spines. The seeds are disc-shaped (discoid) or irregularly shaped.. Additional information. Origin. Prickly Pears occur naturally throughout North and South America.. History of use/introduction. Prickly Pear species were brought to Australia on the First Fleet with the intention of establishing a cochineal industry as these species are hosts for the cochineal insects. Opuntia species are cultivated as ornamental, hedge or food plants.. Similar exotic species. Opuntia ficus-indica. Similar native species. Austrocylindropuntia, Opuntia, Cylindropuntia spp.. Suggested method of management and control. Physical removal appears to be one of the most effective control methods for Prickly Pears, but the spines make manual removal of these species difficult. Care must also be taken to remove and properly dispose of, usually by burning, all vegetative and fruit material. The root system must also be dug out to prevent regrowth. While several herbicides are recommended for managing Prickly Pears, chemical control is not always effective as many species occur on rocky slopes, and infested areas must be checked and resprayed over several years if necessary. Biological control using Cactoblastis moths or Cochineal insects can be effective on dense populations, and outlying plants can be infected by transferring infected pads to them. However, there are a number of species of Cochineal insects that are host specific and may destroy one species of Opuntia but not others. The effect of these agents appears to be limited in colder climates. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.

"Oxalis","Oxalis pes-caprae","General Biology. Growth form. Geophyte. Life form. Annually renewed bulb. Reproduction. Bulbils. Dispersal. Soil, birds. Fire response. Generally survives fire. Notes. In South Africa Oxalis pes-caprae is represented by diploid and tetraploid races. The short styled, sterile pentaploid race reported as invasive elsewhere is apparently uncommon in South Africa. Throughout most of its invasive range O. pes-caprae reproduces asexually by bulbils, rarely setting seed. Prefers disturbed sites. Some evidence it influences soil phosporous cycling. Soil disturbance can greatly enhance invasion. Additional information. Origin. South Africa. Suggested method of management and control. Spot spray metsulfuron methyl 0.2 g/15 L + PulseÂ®, or 1% glyphosate. Apply at bulb exhaustion, generally just on flowering. Exercise care if manually removing as physical removal can result in spread of bulbils. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.

"Paspalum","Paspalum dilatatum","General Biology. Growth form. Grass. Life form. Perennial, caespitose/shortly rhizomatous. Reproduction. Seed, short rhizomes. Dispersal. Seed spread by animals, clothing, shoes, water, wind, machinery. Vegetative spread by earth-moving, cultivation, inappropriate planting. Photosynthetic Pathway. C4. Toxicity. Not toxic itself however fungus-infected seedheads pose a threat to animal health. Fire response. Will quickly resprout from rootstock when conditions become favourable. Notes. Widely naturalised particularly in sub-tropical and warm temperate climates, especially those with summer rainfall. Common in all Australian states in pastures, roadsides, gardens or lawns. A major weed of wetland edges, wet native grasslands and road drains. Susceptible to frost, however winter dormancy may enable it to survive frost in some areas. For active growth requires high temperatures, irrigation and high soil nitrogen levels. Has low salintiy tolerance however a deep root system confers significant drought tolerance once established. Flowering commences in early to mid summer, coinciding with a marked slowing in vegetative growth. Flowering continues through autumn, with little foliage produced until the following spring. Seed production is inhibited at temperatures below 13Â°C. Viability is often low and affected by ergot infection. Seed is sticky and is easily unintentionally dispersed. Disturbance events that create gaps (such as flooding and heavy grazing) promote recruitment. Vegetative spread is extremely slow. There are at least 5 different cultivars and 8 biotypes, with significant variation in seed production, quality and growth rates between genotypes. Can form hybids with Paspalum urvillei. Additional information. Origin. South America. History of use/introduction. Summer pasture, erosion control particularly where there is water movement. Similar exotic species. Paspalum urvillei.

Can form very large dense stands in wetlands where it is able to have a significant impact on plant and animal diversity. Long-lived and fast growing with a very vigorous and invasive running rootstock. Capable of reproduction by seeds, but primarily reproduces asexually by rhizomes. Seed viablity and dormancy differs greatly, seed generally has low viablity, but prolific amounts are produced. Disturbance that removes competitors and enriches nutrients strongly promotes spread. Dispersal to new sites is typically by seed. Moderately tolerant of saline water. Allelopathic. Additional information. Origin. Occurs in Europe, Asia, Africa, America, Australia, however its true origin is unclear. History of use/introduction. Grown commercially, thatching, fodder, cellulose production, erosion control, medicine, edible foods. Suggested method of management and control. In summer dry areas, slashing over succesive years reduces biomass. Spot spray with glyphosate in late summer/early autumn after flowering or apply as a cut stump treatment. Repeated treatments for several years are often required. Herbicides in combination with burning can be effective. Repeated cutting or breaking of stems below the water level may be effective, however may not kill all stems. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.

Wind, water, birds, contaminated seed, on footware and clothing, mowers and other equipment. Photosynthetic Pathway. C3. Seedbank persistence. 4-6 years. Notes. Generally a weed of disturbed sites usually with limited impact on native plant communities. Survives as a weed due to high genotypic and phenotypic variability, rapid germination, survival when uprooted and tolerance to compacted soils. Grows aggressively under moist conditions, good levels of soil nitrogen and phosphate and is not adversely affected by most mowing heights. Tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions, making it a potentially invasive species for a range of areas including the Sub-Antarctic Islands. Can flower and establish at any time of the year, although this is less likely under dry conditions. Generally has high seed production. Seed has generally high viablity and staggered germination. Most seed germinates within the first year and when soil is wet during the winter months. Additional information. History of use/introduction. Potential seed contaminant. Similar exotic species.

Vegetative regeneration strategy. Resprouts, produces root suckers, stem layering. Seedbank persistence. Soil, short, days-1 year. Fire response. Can regenerate from roots following fire, cool fire will result in rapid regrowth from crown, hot fire will kill crown, but rapid regrowth will occur from root suckers. Notes. In 2004/2005 herbarium collections of blackberry were made across the state as part of a NRM project to determine the overall distribution and incidence of weedy blackberry taxa. It identified WA has several weedy Rubus species, with no native Rubus species. For further information on identification refer to Barker and Barker (2005) Blackberry: an identification tool to introduced & native Rubus in Australia [CD-ROM] or CSIRO (2005) Field guide for the identification of WA blackberry. R. anglocandicans was previously misidentified as R. discolor in Western Australia and as R. procerus in south-eastern Australia. It is the most common, widespread and dominant weedy blackberry in WA. Occurs from Perth to Albany. Forms dense, impenetrable thickets that crowd out native plants and increase fire risk. Susceptible to the rust Phragmidium violaceum. At one site near Perth it co-occurs with R. laudatus and R. ulmifoloius, indicating the ability of all three species to colonise the same habitat. Additional information. Origin. Central/eastern Europe. History of use/introduction. Garden escape. Similar exotic species. R. ulmifolius, R. laudatus. Suggested method of management and control. Spray with metsulfuron methyl 1 g/10 L + the wetting agent EndoseÂ® at 30 ml/10 L, in summer-autumn. Will require follow up for a number of years. For small infestations or in sensitive areas hand pull small plants or seedlings. For larger plants cut and paint with 20-50% glyphosate or slash canes. Spray regrowth at 50cm with metsulfuron methyl 1 g/10 L + the wetting agent EndoseÂ® at 30 ml/10 L, in summer-autumn.

Vegetative regeneration strategy. Resprouts, produces root suckers, stem layering. Woody structure. Diffuse porous. Seedbank persistence. Short, days-1 year. Fire response. Green foliage and timber will burn in a hot fire. Established trees may be killed, younger trees may resprout. Notes. Distinguished by its long slender weeping twigs. Earliest flowering tree willow. Serious creekline weed in eastern Australia. Frequently seen in gardens. Biological control of six willow species is under consideration in Australia. The species is not currently listed as a WONS, however it is still of concern for its potential to hybridise and spread in natural areas. In tree willows (subgenus Salix) the catkins emerge with the leaves, unlike shrub willows (subgenus Vetrix) where the catkins emerge well before the leaves. Readily grows from broken branches. Increases likelihood of bank erosion and large scale soil movement over time. Consumes large amounts of water. Massive leaf drop in autumn significantly affects water quality. Can form hybrids with S. alba and S. fragilis. Only female plants have been recorded in Western Australia. Additional information. Origin. China. History of use/introduction. Garden escape, riverbank stabilisation. Similar exotic species. Salix matsudana, S. sepulcralis. Suggested method of management and control. Hand pull seedlings. Cut and paint or stem inject using 50% glyphosate throughout the year, however results may be variable in spring. Check restrictions on chemical use near waterways. Follow-up monitoring and control of regrowth from stumps, pieces of stems or seeds may be required for 3-5 years after initial control.

"Solanum","Solanum nigrum","General Biology. Growth form. Herb. Life form. Annual. Reproduction. Seed. Dispersal. Birds, water, soil, machinery. Toxicity. Variably toxic. Green fruit and leaves may at times contain toxic alkaloids. Seedbank persistence. 5+ years. Notes. Common agricultural and bushland weed. May be biennial particularly in milder conditions, where it may live from 2-5 years. Competes vigorously for space and nutrients. Morphologically variable. Has a taproot and many lateral roots, with a high shoot to root ratio. Flowering occurs 5-9 weeks after germination and continues until the plant dies. Early germinating plants take several weeks more to flower compared to late germinating plants. Produces prolific seed. Seed can have high germination rates (>90%) and germination is usually staggered. Alternating temperatures are required to break dormancy and lower light intensities or darkness are generally more favourable for germination. There is vigorous recruitment from soil stored seed in burnt and unburnt areas after rain. Levels of primary seed dormancy among populations, enabling it to maximise its chance of survival by regulating germination timing to favourable conditions. It is therefore best to time weed control measures to larger seedling flushes. Host to nematodes, fungi and viruses. Produces alkaloids, glycosides and accumulates nitrates. Additional information. Origin. Likely Europe. History of use/introduction. Medicines. Similar exotic species. Solanum americanum. Suggested method of management and control. Prevent seed set for several years. Hand weed small infestations. In bushland situations, manually remove plants before flowering. For large infestations, 1 L/ha StaraneÂ® (20 ml/10 L) applied when actively growing in summer, will provide reasonably selective control. Do not use in or near wetlands. Control infestations within 5 km of the target area to reduce dispersal of seed by birds. 1 L/ha 2,4-D amine (500 g/L) or 20 ml/10 L can also be used for control of young plants in early summer.

Water, plantings (lawn), occasionally livestock (seed in dung), machinery,shoes, dumped vegetation/soil, soil movement. Photosynthetic Pathway. C4. Toxicity. Produces allergens in summer. Implicated in calcinosis in cattle. Fire response. Resprouts. Notes. Widely naturalised. Because of its dense growth and long-lived mat habit it can readily smother other species. Tolerant of a wide range of climatic conditions. Extremely shade tolerant, grows on poor soils, salt and drought tolerant, intolerant of heavy frost. Extremely tolerant of defoliation and survives under low fertility. Although commonly found on siliceous and calcareous sands, it can grow on a wide range of well or poorly drained soils, from sandy loams to light clays. Diploid types are more tolerant of cold and frost than many tropical grasses. Triploid types have poor cool season growth. Considerable variation in flowering time and intensity and frost tolerances exists among cultivars. Additional information. Origin. Africa, North and South America. History of use/introduction. Pasture, silage, erosion control, lawn/turf, seed contaminant. Suggested method of management and control.

"Typha","Typha orientalis","General Biology. Growth form. Sedge. Life form. Perennial. Reproduction. Primarily seed, also rhizomes. Dispersal. Wind, water, soil. Notes. Both Typha orientalis (previously classified as naturalised in Western Australia) and T. domingensis are native to Western Australia with both species capable of aggressive invasion that can transform wetland ecosystems unless actively managed. The two species are difficult to separate, and intermediates have been found. Flowers are monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, however both sexes can be found on the same plant) and are wind-pollinated. Seedlings can flower after 6 months. Plants senesce in late summer after flowering. New shoots that are produced in autumn grow slowly over winter. Highly productive. Maximum above ground growth occurs during months of higher temperatures and long photoperiods, whereas productivity of roots and rhizomes is highest during low temperatures and short photoperiods. Loses more organic matter in sites subject to seasonal wet/dry hydrological cycles compared to permanently inundated sites. There can be marked differences in ecotypes. Management of Typha may impact on waterbird roosting sites and habitat. Additional information. Origin. Eastern and northern Australia, temperate and tropical Asia, New Zealand. History of use/introduction. Food, medicines, soil stabilisation, biomass, fibres, water treatment. Similar native species. Typha domingensis. Suggested method of management and control. Please note: A clearing permit or exemption will be required to manage this species within its natural range. Eradication is difficult due to prolific seed production and extensive rhizomatous roots. Apply Roundup BiactiveÂ® (360 g/L) at 13 ml/L when actively growing through wiping, backpack/handheld spray or high volume spray. The optimum time is between male flowers opening and 6 weeks after female flowers open. This period is usually the end of December through to February. Complete coverage of foliage is necessary. Avoid producing run-off or spray drift. Plants with one third of the stem below water may not absorb enough herbicide to be killed by spraying - either wait till water levels are lower or plants have matured. Cutting shoots 15 cm below the water surface two to three times in a season when actively growing, but before seeds are formed, greatly reduces stands. Repeat treatment annually to ensure against reinfestation. To avoid loss of water quality by anaerobic decomposition of dead plant material in water, consider physical removal of dead biomass or burning 6 weeks after spraying. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides. For further information consult the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to determine the status of permits for your situation or state."," general biology. growth form. sedge. life form. perennial. reproduction. primarily seed, also rhizomes. dispersal. plants senesce in late summer after flowering. plants with one third of the stem below water may  enough herbicide to be killed by spraying - either wait till water levels are lower or plants have matured. repeat treatment annually to ensure against reinfestation. to avoid loss of water quality by anaerobic decomposition of dead plant material in water, consider physical removal of dead biomass or burning 6 weeks after spraying. read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides. for further information consult the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority to determine the status of permits for your situation or state.

Seedbank persistence. 2-3 years. Fire response. Seed survives most fires, spring fires kill flowering plants. Notes. Widespread in temperate and subtropical regions and most common on dry, disturbed sites. Is an invasive prevalent weed in Mediterranean ecosystems, where it can negatively impact natural grassland ecosystem function. Cover varies greatly from year to year depending upon rainfall received during the growing season. Able to grow on low fertility compacted soils. Found in open sites and is most common in early succession. Disturbances that expose bare ground favour establishment. Exhibits strongly plastic growth responses. Has high germination rates over a range of temperatures. Fresh seed can germinate and emerge in any season, however most germination occurs with the first significant late summer or early autumn rain. Its post-fire establishment is dependent upon favorable rainfall. Due to long awns, seed can easily attach to animals and disperse long distances. Soil-stored seed is sufficiently abundant to maintain populations in years of low seed production. Seed has high germination rates and this can take place over a range of environmental conditions. Resistant to fops group of herbicides, including fluazifop-butyl (FusiladeÂ® Forte) and TargaÂ®. Additional information. Origin. Mediterranean, northern Africa, temperate and tropical Asia. History of use/introduction. Seed contaminant, erosion control, revegetation, soil improver. Similar exotic species. Vulpia bromoides. Suggested method of management and control.
